      "credits": "1.00",
      "description": "Begins with a reach back in time to the dawn of history 20,000 years ago when the earliest creators in the western world painted powerful images of animals on walls located in the eerie, dank depths of cave interiors. This startling act marked the beginning of communication through visual images. We will move chronologically through history, exploring the major monuments and masterpieces of painting, sculpture and architecture, and the cultures that produced them. By focusing primarily, although not exclusively, on select key monuments\u2014the Pyramids, the Parthenon, the Pantheon\u2014and on the masterpieces of major artists\u2014Raphael, Rembrandt, Renoir, Rothko (among others)\u2014from prehistoric times to our own computer age, we will gain an understanding of visual culture and of the needs and asprations that are expressed.",

      "credits": "1.00",
      "description": "Considers European art and architecture from around 1580 to 1680, the age known as the Baroque. An era of astonishing artistic activity, it was marked by lavish patronage by popes, cardinals and princes, centering on the cosmopolitan capital of Rome. This period was characterized by fundamental changes in society, a re-examining of religious imagery and orthodoxy, new and revolutionary scientific discoveries, a new global awareness and the growth of political absolutism. Explores how these developments informed the style, iconography and patronage of art. Analyzes works by some of the best-known \u201cOld Masters,\u201d including Bernini, Borromini, Caravaggio, Rubens, and Rembrandt. Topics include developments in optics and drama, the rise of landscape painting, still life and genre painting, as well as the concept of the Baroque unity of the arts. Field trips to area museums.",

      "description": "This seminar and practicum is the capstone experience for majors in art history. Students enrolled in this course will serve as PLAs (Peer Learning Assistants) for the art history survey, Arth 010, Stone Age to Our Age. This seminar has two primary goals:1) to explore some of the major critical questions that art historians have asked, and attempted to answer, about our discipline; and 2) to provide guidance and critical support for teaching art history discussion sections. Among the questions that our seminar readings will address: how do we talk and write about art, which is by definition non-verbal, and how do we help others learn to talk and write about art? what is the influence of social and political context on a work of art, and how can we guide others to an appropriate use of this historical information? what makes for an effective discussion group experience?",

The course will focus primarily on late-19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century art, with individual classes devoted to selected artists or thematic issues.",
