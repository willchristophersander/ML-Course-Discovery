This course will approach her work from a broad range of critical perspectives including black feminist thought, psychoanalysis, trauma theory, Biblical exegesis, postcolonial analysis, and critical race theory. Although this class will emphasize rigorous study of her literary work, we will also pay close attention to her contributions to literary criticism, her role in public life as well as her forays into political and national debates. In our study of her novels, we will explore such issues as the importance of history and myth in the creation of personal identity, constructions of race and gender, the dynamic nature of love, the role of the community in social life, and the pressures related to the development of adolescent girls.",

      "description": "Since the 1960's certain Christian theologians have attempted to re-think and re-express their religious beliefs in ways that can lead to the radical transformation of people's lives and social institutions. The movement this group of diverse Christian thinkers has set in motion is often referred to as liberation theology. In this course we will look at the principal ideas of various liberation theologians -- Latin American, Asian, African, Afro-American, and feminist. As well as looking at the ideas of these thinkers, we will also examine the social worlds in which they think and write, thus trying to see the connection between their ideas and the social environments they want to liberate.",

      "description": "The course suggests that there existed two distinct views as to how the new nation would be structured. Once these views clashed and became sectional, the nation was thrown into a political, theological, and, ultimately, a military contest the demands of which led to the incorporation of structural changes that had the effect of resolving the very issues that had propelled the nation into war. As we identify and discuss the causes, conduct, and consequences of the Civil War, we will examine the changing ideas about nation, government, work, race, and gender, and ask: How different were Northern and Southern institutions and, to what extent were northern and southern Americans fundamentally different people?",
