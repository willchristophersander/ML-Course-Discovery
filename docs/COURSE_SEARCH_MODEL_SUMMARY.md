## Model Performance

### Simple Course Search Classifier Results
- **Training Accuracy**: 40% (on small test set)
- **Test Accuracy**: 75% (3/4 correct predictions)
- **Model Type**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: 25 comprehensive features

### Feature Importance Analysis
The model identified these as the most important features:

1. **Word Count** (14.2%) - Total words on the page
2. **Search Pattern Matches** (13.5%) - Course search keywords found
3. **URL Pattern Matches** (10.8%) - Course search URL patterns
4. **Total Course Indicators** (9.0%) - Combined course search indicators
5. **Text Length** (9.2%) - Total text length
6. **Course Keyword Density** (8.4%) - Density of course-related terms

### Test Results
-  **CUNY Global Class Search**: Correctly identified as Course Search (86% confidence)
-  **UC Berkeley Class Schedule**: Correctly identified as Course Search (75% confidence)
-  **UNC Chapel Hill Catalog**: Correctly identified as Catalog (20% confidence)
-  **UT Austin Catalog**: Incorrectly identified as Course Search (57% confidence)

## Key Insights

### What Works Well
1. **URL Patterns**: Course search pages often have specific URL patterns like `/classes`, `/courses`, `/schedule`
2. **Search Functionality**: Pages with advanced filtering, sorting, and search forms are likely course search pages
3. **Content Density**: Course search pages tend to have more course-related keywords
4. **Form Elements**: Presence of search inputs and dropdowns indicates search functionality

### Challenges Identified
1. **Overlap**: Some catalog pages have course search functionality, making classification difficult
2. **Small Dataset**: 24 examples is small for machine learning, leading to some overfitting
3. **Feature Overlap**: Catalog pages can have similar features to course search pages

## Recommendations for Model Architecture

### 1. **Current Approach: Random Forest Classifier**
**Pros:**
- Works well with small datasets
- Provides feature importance
- Handles mixed feature types
- Interpretable results

**Cons:**
- Limited to tabular features
- May not capture complex patterns

### 2. **Recommended Next Steps**

#### A. **Expand Training Data**
- Collect more examples (aim for 100+ URLs)
- Include more diverse university websites
- Add edge cases and ambiguous examples

#### B. **Feature Engineering Improvements**
- Add more sophisticated text analysis
- Include link relationship analysis
- Add page structure analysis
- Consider semantic similarity features

#### C. **Advanced Model Types**

**Graph Neural Network (GNN)**
```python
# Future implementation
import torch_geometric
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class CourseSearchGNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.classifier = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_channels, 1)
```

**Transformer-based Model**
```python
# Future implementation
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

class CourseSearchTransformer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
        self.model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
```

**Ensemble Approach**
```python
# Combine multiple models
class EnsembleCourseSearchClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.random_forest = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.gradient_boosting = GradientBoostingClassifier()
        self.neural_network = MLPClassifier()
```

- **General Features**: Text length, form elements, URL structure
- **Derived Features**: Combined indicators, ratios, scores

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Collect More Data**: Visit more university websites to expand training set
2. **Validate Current Model**: Test on new, unseen URLs
3. **Feature Analysis**: Analyze which features are most predictive
4. **Error Analysis**: Understand why UT Austin was misclassified

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Implement GNN**: Add graph-based analysis for link relationships
2. **Add Transformer**: Use BERT or similar for better text understanding
3. **Create Ensemble**: Combine multiple models for better performance
4. **Optimize Hyperparameters**: Use grid search or Bayesian optimization

### Long-term Vision
1. **Real-time Classification**: Deploy as API service
2. **Continuous Learning**: Update model with new data
3. **Multi-language Support**: Handle international universities
4. **Advanced Features**: Add course recommendation capabilities

## Conclusion

The course search navigator model shows promising results with 75% accuracy on a small dataset. The Random Forest approach provides a solid foundation with interpretable results. The key to improving performance is expanding the training dataset and implementing more sophisticated feature engineering.

The model successfully identifies course search pages based on URL patterns, content analysis, and form elements. With more data and advanced techniques like GNNs and transformers, this could become a highly accurate system for automatically finding course search functionality across diverse university websites.
