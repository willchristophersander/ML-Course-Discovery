I think we should look up how difficult courses are, both generally
and for the specific school attended.

We should try to get the course's sylabus if available, and tailor the reminders/motivation/etc around the
sylabus. For example, if a class is heavy on homework for overall grade we should be intrusive to the user 
in reminding them of each assignment, and even look into fall back methods.

We should also research the courses in question, building up a database of ALL courses. Using this we can:
    1: Estimate difficulty.
        1.5: Using difficulty estimate stress and make user aware AHEAD of the stress, 
        while also suggesting strategies.
    
    2: Provide motivation.
        2.5: We can say how the courses in question will impact their life and abilities. For example, 
        talk of how data structures made doom possible, or how an economics and climate change class is
        pivotal as we face climate change and create new economic systems to confront climate change.
        
        Doing this would allow natural motivation, especially for depressed students.

    3: Provide tools for contacting professors, staff, etc.
        3.5: A more advanced feature might be having a more advanced AI LLM connection, to chatgpt for example, 
        with the app providing relevant information, such as course name, sylabus, future and past assignments,
        etc. Then this chat could be used to suggest new study habits OR provide data to professors/schools 
        in order to help the student. Personalized learning of a sort.
